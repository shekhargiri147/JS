        <h2>Including the JavaScript</h2>
        <p>we can include JavaScript in our HTML in two ways:
            <br>

            1. Writing the code in our HTML <br>
            2. Including it as a link to an external file <br>
            For the most part, we will include the JavaScript as an external file.
            <br><br>


            <b>The Script Tag</b><br>

            The "script" tag is what we use to includes our JavaScript. It's a lot like the "link" tag we've already
            been
            using to include our CSS files. <br><br>

            Here's a very basic snippet of JavaScript using the script tag. This JavaScript is written directly into our
            HTML page. It will call and alert box as soon as the page loads.
            <br><br>


            When using the script tag, we must always use the attribute name and value of type="text/javascript".
            <br><br>


            <b>Using the script file</b><br>
            tag to include an external JavaScript file
            To include an external JavaScript file, we can use the script tag with the attribute src. we've already
            used the src attribute when using images. The value for the src attribute should be the path to our
            JavaScript file.
            <br><br><br>
            script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-javascript-file.js">/script\
            <br><br><br>
            This script tag should be included between the

            "head"tags in our HTML document.
        </p>
