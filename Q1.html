        <h2>Including the JavaScript</h2>
        <p>we can include JavaScript in our HTML in two ways:
            <br>

            1. Writing the code in our HTML <br>
            2. Including it as a link to an external file <br>
            For the most part, we will include the JavaScript as an external file.
            <br><br>


            <b>The Script Tag</b><br>

            The "script" tag is what we use to includes our JavaScript. It's a lot like the "link" tag we've already
            been
            using to include our CSS files. <br><br>

            Here's a very basic snippet of JavaScript using the script tag. This JavaScript is written directly into our
            HTML page. It will call and alert box as soon as the page loads.
            <br><br>


            When using the script tag, we must always use the attribute name and value of type="text/javascript".
